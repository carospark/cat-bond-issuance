# Handoff

Read `PARSER_BACKLOG.md` first. It is the current state: what is parsed, what
is validated, and everything still worth fixing, ordered by value per hour.

## State (2026-09-14)

- Full crawl done: 1,311 deals parsed; `raw/` and `data/` are gitignored under
  the Artemis licence rule (`DATA_POLICY.md`). Code is tracked, content is not.
- `./.venv/bin/python tests/test_golden.py` — expect 626/626, offline.
- `src/validate_dashboards.py` reproduces every publisher comparison. Issuance,
  trigger mix and EL validate; spread carries a bias (backlog 9); the offering
  size-change series does NOT validate (backlog 10).
- The analysis layer lives in the sibling repo `cat-bond-flow-analysis`, which
  consumes `data/deals.csv` and `data/tranches.csv`. Non-USD conversion is
  decided there, not here.

## Testing discipline (hard-won, do not regress)

- Golden tests over `raw/` before any regex surgery; add the case, then fix.
- `REJECT` table: assert the absence of specific known-wrong values. A guard
  that only checks non-`None` passes when extraction fails entirely.
- Unit-test predicates, not just end-to-end: redundant defences mask each other.
- Mutation-test every guard, and verify the mutation actually applied. Never
  trust a green suite whose check count did not move.

## Data caveats

- EL / attachment / spread are sparse before ~2010; those series start there.
- Low Tier-1 fill means a private deal, not an old one. Triage by
  `deal_is_private`, never by year.
- Crawl order is a correctness requirement: prose cites predecessor deals, so
  older siblings must be parsed first (`data/queue.csv`).
