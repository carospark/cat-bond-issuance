# Handoff

Read `PARSER_BACKLOG.md` first. It is the current state: what is parsed, what
is validated, and everything still worth fixing, ordered by value per hour.

## NEXT — start here (set 2026-09-15)

1. **Human-check** these against their Artemis pages. Round one (launch
   sizes that were not sizes):
   - PoleStar Re 2024-3: launch $75m (not the $800m attachment point, not the
     "$400m maximum" speculation)
   - Kilimanjaro III Re 2026-2: launch None, flagged
     `launch_target_shared_across_series` ($530m is across two entries)
   - Sanders Re III 2022-2: launch $250m (not Series 2022-1's $550m)
   - Everglades Re II 2023-1/2023-2: one entry for two series, so "$600m
     across the two series" is kept as this deal's update
   - Meadows Ltd 2025-1: launch $125m (not the investor's $8bn AUM)

   Round two (launch sizes that were one component's; spread = price of par):
   - Kilimanjaro II Re 2025-1: launch None ("$125 million" is the A-1/A-2
     pair's target); Tar Heel Re 2013-1: launch $200m, +150% (page says so)
   - Acorn Re 2024-1: no launch, update $450m (not "$200 million each")
   - Residential Re 2019-2 Class 1: spread 22.75% (not "priced at 77.25%")
   - Merna Re II 2022-2: launch "$500 million" is WRONG (programme total);
     known open, see backlog 10.
2. **Backlog 3 (maturity)** round one done: 120 -> 354 stated maturities.
   Human-check a few `stated_derived_mismatch` deals (stated date should win).
3. **Backlog 10 opens**: the Merna sibling-sum rule is the one with a clear
   mechanism. Backlog 9 (spread) is closed; backlog 1 is down to one
   source typo (Vita Capital VI) and one window bleed (Vitality Re VII).
   Backlog 4 is measured (`src/crosscheck_losses.py`): 1 of 40 settled
   losses is read from the page; the partial-loss remainder phrasing is next.
   Backlog 2: three of four mismatch families fixed; what is left is
   headline-basis representation and phantom tranches.
4. ~~Rename the project~~ done 2026-09-14.

Everything is pushed as of 2026-09-15.

## State (2026-09-15)

- Full crawl done: 1,311 deals parsed; `raw/` and `data/` are gitignored under
  the Artemis licence rule (`DATA_POLICY.md`). Code is tracked, content is not.
- `./.venv/bin/python tests/test_golden.py` — expect 1619/1619, offline.
- `src/validate_dashboards.py` reproduces every publisher comparison. Issuance,
  trigger mix, EL and spread validate (spread: corr 0.90, -0.03pp after the
  2026-09-15 price-of-par fix). The offering size-change series is bracketed
  by two readings (backlog 10); the residual is the publisher's inclusion set.
- The analysis layer lives in the sibling repo `cat-bond-flow-analysis`, which
  consumes `data/deals.csv` and `data/tranches.csv`. Non-USD conversion is
  decided there, not here.

## Testing discipline (hard-won, do not regress)

- Golden tests over `raw/` before any regex surgery; add the case, then fix.
- `REJECT` table: assert the absence of specific known-wrong values. A guard
  that only checks non-`None` passes when extraction fails entirely.
- Unit-test predicates, not just end-to-end: redundant defences mask each other.
- Mutation-test every guard, and verify the mutation actually applied. Never
  trust a green suite whose check count did not move.

## Data caveats

- EL / attachment / spread are sparse before ~2010; those series start there.
- Low Tier-1 fill means a private deal, not an old one. Triage by
  `deal_is_private`, never by year.
- Crawl order is a correctness requirement: prose cites predecessor deals, so
  older siblings must be parsed first (`data/queue.csv`).
